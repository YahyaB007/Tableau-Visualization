**1. Project Title**

🌍 Global Sales & Logistics Performance Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard built on the Global Superstore dataset to analyze worldwide sales, shipment volumes, delivery times, and supply chain efficiency across multiple regions and product categories.


**2. Short Description**

The Global Sales & Logistics Performance Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales, shipping, and discount performance worldwide. It is designed to help businesses, analysts, and managers identify key logistics bottlenecks, regional profit drivers, and cost optimization opportunities.


**3. Tech Stack**

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• 📊 Tableau Desktop – Main visualization platform used to design and develop the dashboard.

• 📂 Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx) – Final project file format containing data and visuals.

• 📝 Calculated Fields & Parameters – To compute KPIs like average delivery time, discount rates, and profit margins.

• 🌐 Geospatial Mapping (Mapbox + Tableau) – For visualizing warehouse-to-region shipment flows.

• 📁 File Format – .twbx for the interactive packaged dashboard and .png for preview snapshots.



**4. Data Source**

Source: Global Superstore Dataset (Global_Superstore2.xlsx)

This dataset contains retail transactional data from a fictional global superstore and includes:

📦 Orders Table: Ship date, order priority, shipping cost, delivery time.

💰 Sales Data: Sales amount, profit, discounts, and quantities.

🛒 Products: Sub-category, category, and product names.

🌍 Geography: Customer location by country, region, and market.

The data is structured to allow multi-dimensional analysis across geography, time, and product sub-categories.




**5. Features**


• Business Problem

Organizations managing global retail operations struggle to track delivery performance, measure profitability by region, and assess logistics efficiency. Data is often scattered, making it hard to gain insights into order priorities, discount effectiveness, and supply chain costs in one unified view.



• Goal of the Dashboard

To deliver a single analytical tool that:

Tracks delivery times over multiple years.

Compares regional sales and shipping volumes.

Analyzes discounts vs. profits by region.

Evaluates order priority vs. shipping cost.

Visualizes global warehouse flows and product movement.

Highlights top-performing sub-categories in sales and quantity.
